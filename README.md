A MS Access application for planing study programs, courses and teaching.

Originally created and maintained by former dean Ottar Ohren. 
Now maintained by Hans Fredrik Nordhaug.

The application can organize all teaching activity at a faculty. 
You can see who is teaching which course, which courses a teacher is responsible for and so on.
Unforunately the user interface is only in Norwegian.

This repository contains the application exported to text files 
(with [msaccess-vcs-integration](https://github.com/bkidwell/msaccess-vcs-integration)) 
and a zip file of the complete application. However, the database with the data structure 
isn't included here (until we get time to clean it up for distribution).

Basically, this is a backup of our work, but feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.
